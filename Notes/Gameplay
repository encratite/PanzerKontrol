This is a crude open source turn-based strategy game inspired by games like Panzer General 2 and Unity of Command.
Currently only a player vs. player mode is planned, no single player.
I'm not sure about the details of the playable factions yet.

Each match is played by two opposing players.
It starts with a picking phase during which players choose the composition of their army.
Each player is given the same amount of points that are used to purchase units.
The picking phase is subdivided into two steps.
In the first step, known as "open picking", each player may use up to 75% of their points to purchase units.
These picks are made visible to the opponent after the completion of this step.
Half the points that are not spent in this step are lost and may not be used in the next step.
In the second step, known as "hidden picking", each player may use the remaining 25% of their points to purchase units.
These picks can be made to counter the majority of the enemy army.

After the completion of the picks, deployment commences.
Players may place their units in their own deployment zones in parallel.
These unit placements are not visible to the enemy until the game has started (there is no fog of war).

Once deployment is complete, the battle commences.
As units move on the map, their area of influence causes hex grids to be captured until they encounter the enemy line of defence.
Each map defines a certain maximum number of turns the game may last.
There are three different ways to win a match:
1. all enemy forces have been destroyed
2. the maximum number of turns have been played and the player controls more grids than their opponent
3. the enemy surrenders
A match can also result in a draw.
This occurs when the maximum number of turns has been played and both players control an equal number of grids on the map.

Now, usually Panzer General style games permit each player to use all their units in one go once it's their turn.
The problem with this approach is that it leads to considerable "downtime" for the other player who is then forced to wait.
This is probably boring and makes the game less enjoyable for the players.
Maps are symmetrical and the only way in which a match is asymmetrical is that one player has the privilege of making the first moves.
To work around these two issues I propose a system in which each turn is subdivided into "microturns" during which only n units may be used.
n = 3 might just do the job.
This would enable players to interact at a greater granularity and also prevents excessive sequential "hit and run" style attacks from four or more units attacking a single target.
