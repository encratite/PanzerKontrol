This is a crude open source turn-based strategy game inspired by games like Panzer General 2 and Unity of Command.
Currently only a player vs. player mode is planned, no single player.
I'm not sure about the details of the playable factions yet.

A match is played by two opposing players.
A certain number of points P_base may be spent to purchase units.
The amount is predefined by the map that is being played.
However, the owner of a custom game may override this value.
Players have already chosen a base army worth 0 < P_army <= P_base before they connect.
The following amount of points may be spent on reinforcements during the game:
P_reinforce = 0.5 * (P_base - P_army) + 0.3 * P_base
These points may be spent on both new units and improving/replenishing existing units.

Once the players have connected, deployment commmences.
Players may place their units in their own deployment zones in parallel.
These unit placements are not visible to the enemy until the game has started (there is no fog of war).

Once deployment is complete, the battle commences.
As units move on the map, their area of influence causes hex grids to be captured until they encounter the enemy line of defence.
Each map defines a certain maximum number of turns the game may last.
There are three different ways to win a match:
1. all enemy forces have been destroyed
2. the maximum number of turns have been played and the player controls more grids than their opponent
3. the enemy surrenders
A match can also result in a draw.
This occurs when the maximum number of turns has been played and both players control an equal number of grids on the map.
