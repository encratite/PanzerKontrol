Playable factions:

1. The Cartel

Description:

The Cartel is a fragile alliance of powerful corporations with well-funded military branches.
Originally they emerged independently as the economically dominant forces in various countries until they effectively controlled local governments.
Realising that they could not expand further on their own, they united in the pursuit of higher profits and greater power.

Units:

-sophisticated technology
-airforce with advanced bombers

Visual inspiration:

-private security contractors in Iraq/Afghanistan
-south/central American drug gangs
-US military equipment

2. Dualists

Description:

The Dualists refer to themselves as the "Children of the Moon and the Sun".
Dualism is a young bitheistic religious movement that was founded by two brothers several centuries ago.
The two are considered the divine prophets of the moon deity and the sun deity, respectively.
Nowadays Dualism is no longer confined to certain ethnic groups and large populations can be found in many places.

In Dualist doctrine only members of the theocratic hierarchy have authority.
This lead to violent clashes between Dualist militants and national security forces in regions under Cartel control.

Units:

-less sophisticated technology
-no airforce
-quantity over quality
-child soldiers
-unlikely to retreat due to religious zeal
-clerics are able to cast spells that harm enemies or help allies

Visual inspiration:

-traditional outfits of adherents of Indian religions, also possibly Islam
-sun and moon banners/insignia
