1. Nomads

Lore:

Hostile steppes gave birth to these nomadic predators. Originally governed by local warlords who were constantly fighting each other, the Nomads formed a fragile alliance in pursuit of more land, cattle, and wives. Their equipment may be crude and some of them are even said to ride into battle on horses, facing machine guns and artillery fire. Yet their greed and especially their cruelty against civilians are widely feared.

2. The Brotherhood

The Brotherhood is a society governed by a powerful elite of clerics who have both civil and religious responsibilities. While the first prophet of their monotheistic faith preached pacifism, his death enabled men with more worldly goals to take over.

In reality, they were frequently the aggressors themselves, a fact the leadership wishes to conceal.
